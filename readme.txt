Display a list of your galleries.

== Description ==

This plugin requires the <a href="http://www.rockettheme.com/">RokGallery</a> plugin for WordPress.
A widget that enables you to display a list of your galleries. You can display the number of images in that gallery and also a cool ratio bar which shows how much of your images are in that gallery. You can also display the galleries in a RokBox popup.

Please note, the "ratio bar" option in the widget outputs the markup used by Bootstrap library, but the plugin does not include Bootstrap's stylesheets in the page. If you're not using a bootstrap based theme, you can use the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> plugin to include the library (or just the Progress Bar component which is used by this plugin).


== Installation ==

1. Upload the whole plugin directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Enjoy!


== Screenshots ==

1. Widget output. Note that ratio bar which displays how many images there are in that gallery.
2. You can enable the RokBox option to display the galleries in a RokBox popup.
